# Python-for-Everybody
Here you'll find the exercises of the book "Python for Everybody" solved by me, so if you have comments or suggestions, please be my guest!

Notes:
  * You also will find the "Assignments" from the "Python for everybody" specialization from Coursera, so before you take a look at them it will be great if you look at the forum or ask, so don't use this as a solution, that will be a bad practice if you really want to learn, and they have ways to notice when you copy, I know that 'cause when I looked for some help I saw some people been "banished" from the course.
  * You can download the book at https://www.py4e.com/book.php
