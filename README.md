# Python-for-Everybody
Here you'll find the the exercises of the book "Python for Everybody" solved by me, so if you have comments or suggestions, please be my guest!

Notes:
  * There are some additional exercises, those are from the "Python for everybody" specialization from Coursera, so before you take a look at them it will be great if you take a look at the forum there, ask if you prefer, so don't use them as a solution, that will be a bad practice if you really want to learn.
  * You can download the book at https://www.py4e.com/book.php
  * I'm Colombian, so I speak Spanish but I'm trying to do this in English 'cause I wanted it to be a little "international".
