Here you'll find the the exercises of the book "Python for Everybody" solved by me, so if you have comments or suggestions, please be my guest!

Notes:
  * You will not find the solutions to the quices or assignments.
  * You can download the book at https://www.py4e.com/book.php
  * I'm Colombian, so I speak Spanish but I'm trying to do this in English 'cause I wanted it to be a little "international".
